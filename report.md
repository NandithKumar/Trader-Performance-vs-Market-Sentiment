# Trader Behavior Insights Report

## Methodology

Trade-level data from Hyperliquid was aggregated to daily metrics per trader, including PnL, win rate, trade frequency, leverage, and position bias.  
This dataset was merged with daily Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed) to analyze how sentiment influences trader behavior and performance.

## Key Insights

1. Trader profitability tends to decline during Fear periods, with higher volatility in returns.

2. Trade frequency and leverage usage increase during Greed conditions, indicating greater confidence and risk-taking.

3. High-leverage traders experience larger swings in outcomes and are more vulnerable during Fear markets.

## Strategy Recommendations

### Strategy 1 — Dynamic Leverage Adjustment
Reduce leverage exposure during Fear periods to limit downside risk and preserve capital.

### Strategy 2 — Sentiment-Aware Trade Activity
Limit excessive trading during volatile conditions to avoid performance degradation due to overtrading.

## Conclusion

Market sentiment significantly affects both trader behavior and performance.  
Incorporating sentiment-aware risk management rules can improve consistency and reduce exposure to adverse market conditions.
